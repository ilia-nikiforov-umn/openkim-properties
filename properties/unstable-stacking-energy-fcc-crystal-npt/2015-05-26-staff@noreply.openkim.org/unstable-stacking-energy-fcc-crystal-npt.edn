   "property-title" "Unstable stacking energy for an fcc crystal at specified temperature and configuration"

   "property-description" "The unstable stacking energy (USE) for a monoatomic fcc crystal at specified pressure and temperature. The USE corresponds to the energy barrier for rigidly slipping one-half of an infinite crystal relative to the other along a <112> direction (fcc partial dislocation direction)."

The orthonormal basis used to express the stress should be aligned with the cubic 4-fold axes of the ideal crystal and the expected form of the stress tensor should be [d d d 0 0 0], where d > 0 indicates tensile stress."
