   "property-title" "Extrinsic stacking fault energy for an fcc crystal at specified temperature and configuration"

   "property-description" "The extrinsic stacking fault (ESF) energy for an fcc crystal at specified temperature and configuration. The configuration is defined by the lattice constant and/or pressure. The ESF corresponds to an ABC|BA|BC stacking which can also be understood as a two-layer twin nucleus."
